# NetworkApp
### A small network application for two machines on unix systems (ubuntu-server)

Run on each machine:

First run the following command  
```chmod +x timeserver.py``` and ```chmod +x timeclient.py```

After running this command, you will be able to run a Python script using the commands  
```./timeserver.py``` and ```./timeclient.py```  
assuming you are in the same directory as your file.

### Attention!
Donâ€™t forget that at the beginning of the script file you have written a shebang for the  
correct Python interpreter (if the scripts are written in Python)
